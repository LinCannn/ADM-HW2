    "You are given two positive integers, $n$ (where 1 ≤ $n$ ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>) and $k$ (where $q$ ≤ $k$ ≤ 100 ). Your task is to express $n$ as the sum of $k$ positive integers, all having the same parity (i.e., all have the same remainder when divided by 2, meaning they are either all even or all odd). In other words, find $a_1$ , $a_2$ , . . . , $a_k$ each $a_i$ > 0 , $n$ = $a_1$ + $a_2$ + . . . + $a_k$ , and all $a_i$ simultaneously are either even or odd. If it's impossible to represent $n$ in this way, report that no such representation exists.\n",

    "Input\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first input line, you will receive a number $t$ (where 1 ≤ $t$ ≤ 100 ), representing the number of test cases. The following $t$ lines will contain two values, $n$ and $k$ , corresponding to each test case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output\n",
    "\n",
    "For each test case, if it is possible to represent $n$ as the sum of $k$ positive integers, all of the same parity (either all even or all odd), print \"YES\" and provide the corresponding values of $a_i$ in the next line. If there are multiple valid solutions, you can print any of them. If such a representation is not possible for a given test case, print \"NO\".\n",

    "   - Please provide an analysis of your code's time complexity using Big O notation.\n",
    "   - Ask an LLM tool (such as ChatGPT, Claude AI, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.) to evaluate the time complexity of your code using Big O notation. Is the assessment accurate? If it differs from your previous analysis, which would be correct? Please explain your reasoning.\n",

    "The `find_sum()` function takes in input two integers: $n$ and $k$ and tells us if we can find $k$ integers of the same parity that sum up to $n$, if this is possible the function prints one of the possible integer sequences that sums up to $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case we have that $n$ is larger than $k$ and they're both even or both odd. In this case it is possible to write $n$ as a sum of $k$ integers of the same parity, in particular we can write $n$ as a sum of $k-1$ ones and $n-(k-1)$, we're certain that this last integer is odd because if both $n$ and $k$ are odd then the difference between $n$, that is odd, and $k-1$ which is even will be an odd number.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case we have that $n$ is odd while $k$ is even, in this case it is impossible to write an odd number as a sum of an even number of even numbers and it's impossible to write an odd number as a sum of an even number of odd numbers. So if $n$ is odd and $k$ is even this function will always return \"NO\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last case, that is $n$ even and $k$ odd, we have that we can write $n$ as a sum of $k$ integers all of the same parity only if $n$&ge;$2k$ and we can write $n$ as the sum of $k-1$ twos and $n-2$ $\\times$ $(k-1)$. We have that $k-1$ is even since $k$ is odd, and $n-2$ $\\times$ $(k-1)$ is even too because $n$ is even and 2 $\\times$ $(k-1)$ is even because it's a multiple of 2. If $n<2k$ we can't write $n$ as a sum of $k$ integers of the same parity, hence the function will print \"NO\"."

In this case we'll have to print \"YES\" and the sequence of integers that sums up to $n$, hence we'll have to do $k$ printing operations that have $O(1)$ time complexity, therefore the time complexity of this algorithm will be $O(k)$.

We think that this isn't correct since it doesn't consider that we have to print multiple times a value if there are $k$ integers of the same parity that sum up to $n$."
