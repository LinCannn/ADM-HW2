# ADM-HW2

Second homework for the course "Algorithms for Data Mining"

This homework is made by the collective effort of the following people:
- Can Lin 1994375,
- Amirhosein Dalvand 2056639,
- Giorgio Taramanni 1961217,
- Gabriele Cabibbo 2196717

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following main files:

### `HW2_ADM.ipynb`
This is the main Jupyter notebook containing all our answers and detailed analysis. It serves as the central document where we:
- Present our solutions to all homework problems
- Show the results of our implementations
- Provide visualizations and explanations of our findings
- Document our approach to solving each task

### `myFunctions.py`
This file contains all the custom functions we implemented for this homework. We separated these functions to:
- Keep the main notebook clean and readable
- Make our code more modular and maintainable
- Allow for easy reuse of functions across different parts of the homework
- Improve code organization and structure

### `Algorithmic_Question.ipynb`
This notebook is dedicated to the algorithmic question and contains:
- Detailed explanation of our proposed algorithm
- Big O complexity analysis of our solution
- Step-by-step breakdown of how the algorithm works
- Implementation and testing of the algorithm

## Additional Files
- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files Git should ignore
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project
